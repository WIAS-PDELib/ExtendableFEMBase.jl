# Function Operators

## StandardFunctionOperators

`StandardFunctionOperators` are abstract types that represent fundamental (linear) operators, such as the identity, gradient, divergence, and others. These operators provide a unified interface for evaluating finite element basis functions in various ways.

!!! note

    The transformation from the reference domain to the physical domain differs for each finite element class. As a result, the evaluation of each function operator must be implemented specifically for every finite element class. Not all function operators are currently available for every dimension or element type, but new implementations are added as needed or upon request.
    
    Additionally, function operators can be combined with user-defined kernels to postprocess/construct more advanced operators from the available primitives (for example, the deviatoric part of a tensor).

## ReconstructionOperators

Special operators are provided to evaluate a primitive operator on a reconstructed version of a test function. These are useful for advanced discretizations and post-processing.

### Divergence-Free Reconstruction Operators

For gradient-robust discretizations of certain classical non-divergence-conforming ansatz spaces, reconstruction operators are available that map a discretely divergence-free H1 function to a pointwise divergence-free H(div) function. Currently, such operators are implemented for the vector-valued Crouzeix-Raviart (H1CR) and Bernardiâ€“Raugel (H1BR) finite element types, as well as for the P2-bubble (H1P2B) element in two dimensions.

**Example:** `Reconst{HDIVRT0{d}, Identity}` reconstructs the identity operator into HDIVRT0, and is available for `H1BR{d}` and `H1CR{d}` for `d = 1, 2`.



## Operator Pairs (Experimental)

Two function operators can be combined into an `OperatorPair`, allowing you to provide two operators in each argument of an assembly pattern. Both operators must be well-defined on the relevant element geometries and finite element spaces, and their actions must be compatible with the input and result fields. This feature is experimental and may have limitations in some cases. An `OperatorTriple` is also available for combining three operators.
